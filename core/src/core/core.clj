;Squaring Lists Sub-task 1

;Explanation
;There many ways to produce lazy sequences in clojure (e.g. range, take, repeat, iterate, lazy-seq)
;Here is a not so elegant way of doing it through lazy seq recursively
(defn square-list [n]
  (lazy-seq
    (if (not (empty? n))
      (if (number? (first n))
        (cons (* (first n)(first n)) (square-list (rest n)))
        (square-list (rest n))))))

;The map function returns a lazy sequence and are well known in functional programming languages for being powerful
;The filter function is used to remove non-numerical items
;Then the map function applies the anonymous function #(* % %) (where % is the current list item) to each item
;Finally a lazy sequence of the squared list items is returned
(defn map-square [n]
  (map #(* % %) (filter number? n)))
(map-square [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9])
