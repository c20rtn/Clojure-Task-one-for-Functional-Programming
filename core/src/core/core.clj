;Squaring Lists Sub-task 1

;Explanation
;There many ways to produce lazy sequences in clojure (e.g. range, take, repeat, iterate, lazy-seq)
(defn square_list [n]
  (lazy-seq
    (if (not (empty? n))

        (square_list (rest n))
        ))))

;The map function returns a lazy sequence and are well known in functional programming languages for being powerful
;The filter function is used to remove non-numerical items
;Then the map function applies the anonymous function #(* % %) (where % is the current list item) to each item
;Finally a lazy sequence of the squared list items is returned

(defn map-square [n]
  (map #(* % %) (filter number? n)))
(map-square [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9])

  ;I have tried many steps in trying to memoise in steps of 1, 100 and 1000 and have timed each in a new REPL

  ;Incrementing by 1 is slightly slower than 10 while 100 is faster than both in large amounts (e.g. 100000 cents)
  ;On smaller amounts (e.g. 242) it makes sense to keep it incrementing by 1 or at a push 10 as incrementing 100 or 1000
